                        Surveillance Spy and Patrolling Robot
                    </h3>
                    <p class="pyra">Nowadays robot plays a vital role in our day to day life
                        activities thus reducing human labor and human error. Robots
                        can be manually controlled or can be automatic based on the
                        requirement. The purpose of this robot is to roam around and
                        provide audio and video information from the given
                        environment and to send that obtained information to the
                        user. In this project, one can control the robot with the help of
                        mobile or laptop through Internet of Things (IoT) and also can
                        get the live streaming of video both in daytime as well as at
                        night with the help of wireless camera from the robot. The
                        robot can be controlled both in manual as well as in automated
                        mode with the help of Arduino microcontroller. This robot
                        also uses various sensors that collects data and sends it to the
                        Arduino microcontroller which controls the robot behavior.
                        Along with the obtained live streamed video output, user can
                        also obtain the presence of metal bombs using metal detectors.
                        Thus the action of surveillance can be performed. Further
                        advancement in our project can provide surveillance even in
                        defense areas.</p>
                        <img class="robot"

                        <p class="pyara">The system consists of two major sections - one is the
                            user section and other is the robot section. In that the user
                            section can possess laptop or mobile for communicating
                            with the robot end. Thus by using a laptop or a mobile the
                            user section can be a portable one compared to those that
                            uses a typical stationary computer system. The
                            communication can be performed with RF technology or by
                            using a Zigbee device or by using a Bluetooth technology,
                            but that comes at the cost of limited range. Thus in order to
                            implement the idea of increasing the range we can go
                            connecting the user section with the internet which is the
                            main concept of Internet of Things. For connecting the user
                            system with the internet.
                            At the robot end, we are using an Arduino
                            microcontroller placed on the body or the chassis of the
                            robot, which is the integral part of the robotic vehicle.
                            Below the chassis, the wheels are connected with DC
                            motors that are of 30 rpm each. Each motor requires 12v
                            supply, supplied by means of an external battery source.
                            The motors are interfaced with the Arduino through relay
                            driver. Four relay drivers are employed for two motors and
                            they are used for amplification purpose. The
                            microcontroller is coded with IDE software in order to
                            operate the robot in appropriate directions. This is the
                            manual mode operation associated with it. Several sensors
                            such as ultrasonic sensor, infrared sensor are also used
                            which are interfaced with the microcontroller in the
                            respective I/O pins. Ultrasonic sensor operates by reflection
                            principle, that is by transmission and reception of signals
                            obstacles are detected. In short, it follows the principle of
                            bats termed as echo location. Similarly, Infrared sensors are
                            used to emit and detect infrared radiations, so that the
                            surrounding temperature changes can be detected.</p>
